# Milestone Unlock: Machine Sourced (Tier 5)

![Machine Sourced](../../img/machine_sourced.png) Machine Sourced adds recipes for adding equipment into factory chains. It also adds some recipes for automating equipment production that does not have any, such as medical inhalers.

Consider these recipes to be used in alternate chains of production, so any factories that are created to produce equipment for Pioneer use can continue to run in providing a source material for higher recipe chains once storage units are full. 

They can also be used to simplify or reduce the footprint of a production chain, as any recipe that uses them has its number of required inputs reduced by using this alternate

## Synthetic Inhaler
* **10 Rotor, 20 Coal -> 4 Medical Inhaler (25 Rotors/min, 20 Coal/min -> 10 Medical Inhalers per minute)**
* *Assembler: Cycle Time: 24 seconds -> 2.5 cycles per minute*

> *Ficsit Medical Science teams are always looking toward the cutting edge of technology and development to support  the Pioneers bravely existing on the edges of our known universe. As such, the Synthetic Inhaler has been approved for initial testing by all Pioneers more than 150 LY from HQ. Please do not attempt to report any issues with this inhaler, as the lag time for messages means by the time it is received the product has already undergone several hundred iteration changes.*
>
> Warning: Has been known to cause explosive decompression of lungs, bleeding through the eyes, ears, and nose, and occasional dizziness followed by sudden death. Use at your own risk.

* This recipe adds a way to make Medical Inhalers without utilizing an bio components, opening up their use in other production chains added by this mod.

## Xeno-Zapper Conduit
* **25 Quickwire, 15 Rubber -> 1 Xeno-Zapper (50 Quickwire/min, 30 Rubber/min -> 2 Xeno-Zappers per minute)**
* *Assembler: Cycle Time: 30 seconds -> 2 cycles per minute*

> *The Xeno-Zapper, standard equipment for any Pioneer being deployed for the first time, contains a multiple mini-fission reactor in parallel, each powered by a micro gram of Dilithium. They have a half-life of 3212.92 standard galactic years, and are well suited for early exploration of a new planet. While not approved by Ficsit Approved Specialized Use, enterprising Pioneers on the frontier have made use of the capacitor for various other recipes. Such Pioneers have slipped into the Recipe databases of Assemblers a version of the Xeno-Zapper that allows access to the reactor to be reached easier by other recipes. While it can be done with traditional Xeno-Zappers, those are usually hand crafted and that would be against the tenants for Pioneers - Automate.*

* This recipe adds the Xeno-Zapper to automation, opening up their use in further production chains from this mod.

## Pre-Packaged Parachute
* **10 Fabirc, 5 Cable -> 5 Parachute (60 Fabric/min, 30 Cable/min -> 30 Parachute/min)**
* *Assembler: Cycle Time: 10 seconds -> 6 cycles per minute*

> *Pioneers! Ficsit Morale Assurance Staff have completed their most recent Decennial survey, and your wishes have been heard! Parachutes have been entered into the official Recipe options for Assemblers!*
>
> *- Ficsit is not responsible for any death or injury due to sudden failure of Parachute device or from lack of buoyant support that results in un safe velocities upon impact with ground and/or other stationary or mobile objects of a too be determined weight and mass. See Section 10-A-33 page 4, paragraph 7 of your Pioneer Indentured Service Agreement, section titled **Non Liability To Company in cases of Death, Dismemberment, Injury***

* Nothing special about this recipe, it is the standard Parachute but automated. Helps to enable further production chains within the Machine Sourced Milestone

## Alternate: Capacitor Computers
* **10 Circuit Boards, 1 Xeno-Zapper -> 1 Computer (60 Circuit Boards/min, 6 Xeno-Zappers/min -> 6 Computers/min)**
* *Assembler: Cycle Time: 10 seconds -> 6 cycles per minute* 

> ```There is no Recipe by that name in the Official Ficsit Approved Recipe Database```


> *Ficsit Pioneers are often left to their own devices. One such Pioneer discovered a way to use the multiple mini-fusion reactors in the Xeno-Zapper to power Computers. They slipped this recipe into the Assembly subsystem and enterprising Pioneers can 'discover' it for themselves, along with a paired recipe for a Xeno-Zapper that is slightly easier for the Assembler to dissemble - It does mean quite a bit more circuit boards and other ingredients, but it can be done within an Assembler for less power and total machines*

* This recipe overall costs more basic ingredients, but produces more computers per minute and requires fewer machines than some other recipes (or similar, but far less power)

## Alternate: Silk Reinforced Frames
* **20 Parachutes, 11 Modular Frames -> 2 Heavy Modular Frames (30 Parachutes/min, 9 Modular Frames/min -> 3 Heavy Modular Frames/min)**
* *Assembler: Cycle Time: 40 seconds -> 1.5 cycles per minute*

> *Researchers on  Delta Herculis B have discovered a way to procure silk like fabric substances from any Arachnid-Like fauna in the known universe. As such, the applications due to the intense tensile strength of such creatures are vast. Ficsit has seen fit to approve the recipe for Silk Reinforced Frames to aid in your construction efforts of larger and more powerful machines*

* Reduces the need for a Manufacturer for Heavy Modular Frames, leading to significantly less power draw to produce the same amount of Heavy Modular Frames, at a cost of a few additional Modular Frames per HMF and a different production chain for fabric (which adds oil into the mix if going completely automated)

## Alternate: Primitive Adaptive Control Units
* **1 Portable Miner, 2 Computers, 6 AI Limiters -> 1 Adaptive Control Unit (2 Portable Miner/min, 3 Computers/min, 12 AI Limiters/min -> 1 Adaptive Control Unit/min)**
* *Manufacturer: Cycle Time: 120 seconds -> 1 cycle per minute*
* [Math for just modded recipe](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/machine_sourced/adaptive_control_unit/adaptive_control_unit_modded.md)
* [Other Maths](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/machine_sourced/adaptive_control_unit/)
  
> *Previous incarnations of* **The Project** *had less sophisticated requirements and could easily make do with sub-par parts. While this output is not ideal for current situations, Pioneers finding themselves in situations where power is at a premium can make use of this less efficient recipe to gain a savings in power over all, at the cost of some additional raw resources*

* Reduces the total number of machines by removing the Automated Wiring and HMF components. However, if using only standard recipes, requires a significant increase in Oil to produce the plastic and the addition of Caterium.
