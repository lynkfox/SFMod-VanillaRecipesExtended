Power Overwhelming! adds recipes that are generally easy to produce at lower levels, but instead use higher tier machines - mostly Manufacturers, Refineries, and Blenders, to produce higher quantities of low tier materials. These recipes are designed to be used to maximize your factories output when you have power to burn. Because power usage in itself is not that much of a limiting factor in late game Satisfactory when Nuclear is just around the corner from Tier 7, the other draw back to these recipes is weird inputs and outputs in terms of numbers, making balancing across multiple lines more difficult.

## Alternate: 3D Printed Object Scanner
* **5 Iron Ingot, 1 Rubber, 1 Plastic -> 1 Object Scanner (15 Iron Ingots/min, 3 Rubber/min, 3 Plastic/min -> 3 Object Scanner/min)**
* *Assembler: Cycle Time: 20 seconds -> 3 cycles per minute*

> *TBD*

* A Quicker, but no screw alternative for the Object Scanner (For use in Machine Sourced recipes)

## Alternate: Silk Reinforced Steel
* **1 Fabric, 28 Iron Ore, 28 Coal -> 42 Steel Ingots (3 Fabric/min, 84 Iron Ore/min, 84 Coal/min -> 126 Steel Ingots/min)**
* *Manufacturer: Cycle Time: 20 seconds -> 3 cycles per minute)*
* [Math for just modded recipe](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/power_overwhelming/steel_ingots/steel_ingot_modded.md)
* [Other Maths](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/power_overwhelming/steel_ingots/)

> *Ficsit Understands. Ficsit Cares. With the popularity of the Silk Reinforced Heavy Modular Frames, we have had our developers working hard on incorporating the process into the creation of standard Steel Ingots to increase their tensile strength. Unfortunately, the cafeteria was serving tacos and the schematic for Silk Reinforced Steel never went through final testing before being accidentally bundled into a release. As it has already seen use in some distant Ficsit outposts, it was deemed a low priority to update, and more pressing issues with a higher RoI have been prioritized. Unfortunately, like all provided recipes in this package, the values are difficult to bring into round, pleasing numbers. Our AI generated efficiency models ensure Corporate this is the best and most efficient way to process these recipes.*

* This recipe uses less iron and coal, though oil is somewhat high (but if combined with other recipes using Fabric from this mod there is less issues) than the most common steel ingot recipes, and produces more per minute than either of them as well. Unfortunately, do to the lack of testing by Ficsit, it produces an odd amount at 100% efficiency, making belt management in your factory a bit more interesting to deal with...

## Alternate: Electroplated Iron Plate
* **2m^3 Sulfuric Acid, 5 Iron Plates, 1 Plastic -> 2 Reinforced Iron Plate (8.571 m^3 Sulfuric Acid/min, 21.429 Iron Plate/min, 4.286 Plastic/min -> 8.571 Reinforced Iron Plates/min)**
* *Blender: Cycle Time: 14 seconds -> 4.286 cycles per minute)*
* [Math for just modded recipe](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/power_overwhelming/reinforced_iron_plate/reinforced_iron_plate_modded.md)
* [Other Maths](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/power_overwhelming/reinforced_iron_plate/)

> *Electroplating is an ancient, 20th and 21st century technology that was quickly replaced by Quark-Fracking Alloy applications developed in the late 22nd century. It has been shown to be highly in-efficient in terms of power and in the late 21st century was almost entire banned in the Power Wars of 2087 and 2099. However, such power concerns are not an issue for Pioneers at such a distance from regulatory bodies and enforcement, and as such is now available for Pioneers to use who are willing to spend additional power. Unfortunately, like all provided recipes in this package, the values are difficult to bring into round, pleasing numbers.*

* Making use of the blender and Sulfuric Acid + Plastic to electroplate Iron onto the plastic in an iron ore efficient recipe that requires more complexity but grants more RIP per Iron

## Alternate: Pure Steel Beams
* **2m^3 Nitric Acid, 27 Steel Ingot, 12m^3 Water -> 17 Steel Beam, 3m^3 Sulfuric Acid (3.4286 m^3 Nitric Acid/min, 46.286 Steel Ingot/min, 54.857 m^3 Water/min -> 29.143 Steel Beams/min, 5.142m^3 Sulfuric Acid/min)**
* *Blender: Cycle Time: 35 seconds -> 1.714 cycles per minute)*
* [Math for just modded recipe](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/power_overwhelming/steel_beam/steel_beam_modded.md)
* [Other Maths](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/power_overwhelming/steel_beam/)

> *Ficsit Pioneers have reported that some of the Steel Beam production, using in-situ sourced Iron and Coal or other carbon-based products have had issues with purity. By using Nitric Acid, Ficsit will burn off any additional Sulfur that remains and produce better, higher quality steel which will make far less needed per beam. Unfortunately, like all provided recipes in this package, the values are difficult to bring into round, pleasing numbers.*

* A blender based recipe for 'purifying' steel of sulfur impurities. Creates more Steel Beams/min and uses less Ingots ,at the cost of adding Nitrogen Gas and Water - and having to deal with a byproduct of Sulfuric Acid.

## Alternate: Carbon Lattice Pipe
* **5 Compacted Coal, 45 Quartz Crystal, 2 Steel Ingot -> 14 Steel Pipe(13.043 Compacted Coal/min, 117.39 Quartz Crystal/min, 5.2174 Steel Ingots/min -> 36.522 Steel Pipe/min)**
* *Manufacturer: Cycle Time: 23 seconds -> 2.609 cycles per minute)*
* [Math for just modded recipe](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/power_overwhelming/steel_pipe/steel_pipe_modded.md)
* [Other Maths](../../Documentation/recipe_comparisons/power_overwhelming/steel_pipe/)

> *Good news pioneer! Ficsit is making available the Carbon Lattice based Nano Tubing that was used to construct the Space Elevator Cables. These tubing are incredibly strong and resilient, as well as extremely flexible over extreme distances. For Pioneer based purposes you probably wont find much need for the flexibility, especially at such small scale, but regardless it is now available.*

* Replacing most of the steel for Pipe with other materials - Quartz and Compacted Coal - a much more iron friendly pipe recipe that produces slightly more Pipes per minute as well.
