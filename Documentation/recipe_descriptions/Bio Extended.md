# ![Bio Extended](../../img/bio_extended.png) Milestone Unlock: Bio Extended (Tier 3)

Bio Extended adds alternate recipes for using up all that Bio you've accumulated after finally getting Coal online. Converting this Bio into Coal for backup incase your generators pull to much or to add a little bit of flex into your chains where coal is being used for Steel or Coke and must be transported across distances - which can lead to gaps in input.

Or, make use of the conversion to Biomass or to Mycelia and produce more Health Hypos or Fabric for your needs.

## **Alternate: Carbon Charcoal**

* **100 Leaves -> 30 Coal (500 leaves/minute -> 150 coal/minute)**
* *Constructor: Cycle Time: 12 seconds -> 5 cycles per minute*

> *Through a new pressure based conversion technology, small amounts of charcoal can be generated through a conversion process similar to carbon as it approaches a diamond state. The select application of heat allows for a Charcoal like substance.*
	
* This recipe is slightly more efficient than Wood to Coal (Charcoal) alternate, but takes far more input per minute (a full stack of leaves)
	
## **Alternate: PressBoard** 

* **125 Leaves -> 16.5 Wood (250 leaves/minute -> 33 wood/minute)**
* *Constructor: Cycle Time: 30 seconds -> 2 cycles per minute*

> *The 'I-K Ah' Corporation has shared their technical know how of "PressBoard©" that they use in all their construction efforts. Ficsit has paid a small sum (1.3 Trillion Credits) to license this proprietary technology from them. Ficsit proprietary methods of construction with 'Concrete Laced Nanites' far exceed the construction properties of "PressBoard©" and as such its only good for burning in bio generators. It can be 're-processed' into Biomass at a slightly more efficient rate per bushel of leaves than otherwise.*

* Combining this recipe with any other Wood-> Biomass/Biofuel/Coal recipe slightly enhances the rates of conversion over using Leaves-> Biomass/Biofuel/Coal paths, but at the cost of an extra step in the chain and several more machines for the same amount of output.
	
## **Alternate: Mycelia Growbeds** 

* **Petals: 500 Petals -> 20 Mycelia (250  petals/minute -> 10 mycelia/minute)**
* **Leaves: 200 Leaves -> 40 Mycelia (100 leaves/minute -> 10 mycelia/minute)**
* *Constructor: Cycle Time: 120 seconds -> 0.5 cycles per minute*

> *Ficist Pioneer 1127-B-C-#21 Reported an infestation of Mycelia like spores within an Industrial Storage Unit that was used for storing petals. Further investigation revealed a crack in the containment unit (A .00001% chance of failure that was deemed acceptable risk) of the "Hyperbolic-T Compression Chamber" power source. The energy that leaked combined with the native spores that lay dormant to accelerate their growth. Ficsit does not waste, so this was immediately published to all Pioneers for consumption along with specifications on how to create a controlled leak in the Containment source of the Ficsit Constructor.*

* At what seems like a very low conversion rate, with a cycle time of two minutes, this seems like a recipe that may not be worth it. Consider however the abundance of flower petals/leaves compared to Mycelia, and how just 15 Mycelia can produce 150 Biomass, or .08 mycelia per Coal produced (if using Biocoal)

## **Biomass (Bacon Agaric)**

* **1 Bacon Agaric -> 25 Biomass (10 Bacon Agaric/minute -> 250 Biomass per minute)**
* *Constructor: Cycle Time: 6 seconds -> 10 cycles per minute*

> *It took some time, but Ficsit engineers finally arrived at the optimal "Do not waste" configuration for mulching and compacting the native species of Bacon Agaric into usable Biomass. Please note, Ficsit holds no responsibility if this resources is discovered to be non-renewable. Burn for fuel at your own risk*

* This is your standard conversion to biomass recipe.

## **Alternate: BA-Growbeds**

* **Petals 500 -> 10 Bacon Agaric (250 Petals/minute -> 5 Bacon Agaric/min)**
* **Leaves 200 -> 14 Bacon Argaric (100 Petals/minute -> 7 Bacon Agaric/min)**
* *Constructor: Cycle Time: 120 seconds -> 0.5 cycles per minute*

## **Alternate: Stinger-Silk**
* **Stinger Remains 1 -> 20 Fabric (4 Stinger Remains/min -> 80 Fabric/min)**
* *Constructor: Cycle Time: 15 seconds -> 4 cycles per minute*

> *It has been a well documented fact that Arachnid and Arachnid-Like fauna exist throughout the known universe. Since the suspiciously capable psychic wail was immediately debilitating to human explorers of Delta Herculis B (despite all other creatures of the same planet with similar psychic defense mechanisms producing nothing other than a small buzzing sensation at the base of the neck) it has been suspected that some sort of deep rooted, genetic instinct has programmed humans to be wary of these types of multi-limbed creatures. Much like the Uncanny Valley effect has tenuous links to be due to influence from Lambda Sagittarii C ancient ruins, it is believed that Arachnid-Like fauna is so prevalant among the universe that something must have caused enough scaring of the collective psyche of early humans to imprint on their DNA.*
> 
> *Ficsit has approved the use of Arachnid-Like remains that may have spinners or spinnerets like organs in the production of silk and other silk-like-bundles for general purpose use.*

* This is a recipe to provide an alternate use for Alien Remains (Stinger).
