# ![Machine Sourced](../../img/machine_sourced.png) Milestone Unlock: More Power, More Output! (Tier 7)

More Power, More Output! adds recipes that are generally easy to produce at lower levels, but instead use higher tier machines - mostly Manufacturers, Refineries, and Blenders, to produce higher quantities of low tier materials. These recipes are designed to be used to maximize your factories output when you have power to burn.

## Alternate: 3D Printed Object Scanner
* **10 Rotor, 20 Coal -> 4 Medical Inhaler (25 Rotors/min, 20 Coal/min -> 10 Medical Inhalers per minute)**
* *Assembler: Cycle Time: 24 seconds -> 2.5 cycles per minute*

> *TBD*

* A Quicker, but no screw alternative for the Object Scanner (For use in Machine Sourced recipes)
