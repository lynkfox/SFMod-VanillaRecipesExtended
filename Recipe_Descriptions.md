# Milestone Unlock: Bio Extended (Tier 3)

![Bio Extended](img/bio_extended.png) Bio Extended adds seven alternate recipes for using up all that Bio you've accumulated after finally getting Coal online. Converting this Bio into Coal for backup incase your generators pull to much or to add a little bit of flex into your chains where coal is being used for Steel or Coke and must be transported across distances - which can lead to gaps in input.

Or, make use of the conversion to Biomass or Mycelia and produce more Health Hypos or Fabric for your needs.

## **Alternate: Carbon Charcoal**

**100 Leaves -> 30 Coal (500 leaves/minute -> 150 coal/minute)**

> *Through a new pressure based conversion technology, small amounts of charcoal can be generated through a conversion process similar to carbon as it approaches a diamond state. The select application of heat allows for a Charcoal like substance.*
	
* This recipe is slightly more efficient than Wood to Coal (Charcoal) alternate, but takes far more input per minute (a full stack of leaves)
	
## **Alternate: PressBoard** 

**125 Leaves -> 16.5 Wood (250 leaves/minute -> 33 wood/minute)**
> *The 'I-K Ah' Corporation has shared their technical know how of "PressBoard©" that they use in all their construction efforts. Ficsit has paid a small sum (1.3 Trillion Credits) to license this proprietary technology from them. Ficsit proprietary methods of construction with 'Concrete Laced Nanites' far exceed the construction properties of "PressBoard©" and as such its only good for burning in bio generators. It can be 're-processed' into Biomass at a slightly more efficient rate per bushel of leaves than otherwise.*

* Combining this recipe with any other Wood-> Biomass/Biofuel/Coal recipe slightly enhances the rates of conversion over using Leaves-> Biomass/Biofuel/Coal paths, but at the cost of an extra step in the chain and several more machines for the same amount of output.
	
## **Alternate: Mycelia Growbeds** 

**Petals: 500 Petals -> 20 Mycelia (250  petals/minute -> 10 mycelia/minute)**

**Leaves: 200 Leaves -> 40 Mycelia (100 leaves/minute -> 10 mycelia/minute)**

> *Ficist Pioneer 1127-B-C-#21 Reported an infestation of Mycelia like spores within an Industrial Storage Unit that was used for storing petals. Further investigation revealed a crack in the containment unit (A .00001% chance of failure that was deemed acceptable risk) of the "Hyperbolic-T Compression Chamber" power source. The energy that leaked combined with the native spores that lay dormant to accelerate their growth. Ficsit does not waste, so this was immediately published to all Pioneers for consumption along with specifications on how to create a controlled leak in the Containment source of the Ficsit Constructor.*

* At what seems like a very low conversion rate, with a cycle time of two minutes, this seems like a recipe that may not be worth it. Consider however the abundance of flower petals/leaves compared to Mycelia, and how just 15 Mycelia can produce 150 Biomass, or .08 mycelia per Coal produced (if using Biocoal)

## **Biomass (Bacon Agaric)**

**Bacon Agaric

# Milestone Unlock: Machine Sourced (Tier 5)

![Machine Sourced](img/machine_sourced.png) Machine Sourced adds recipes for adding equipment into factory chains. It also adds some recipes for automating equipment production that does not have any, such as medical inhalers.

Consider these recipes to be used in alternate chains of production, so any factories that are created to produce equipment for Pioneer use can continue to run in providing a source material for higher recipe chains once storage units are full. 

They can also be used to simplify or reduce the footprint of a production chain, as any recipe that uses them has its number of required inputs reduced by using this alternate

## Synthetic Inhaler
**10 Rotor, 20 Coal -> 4 Medical Inhaler (25 Rotors/min, 20 Coal/min -> 10 Medical Inhalers per minute)**

> *Ficsit Medical Science teams are always looking toward the cutting edge of technology and development to support  the Pioneers bravely existing on the edges of our known universe. As such, the Synthetic Inhaler has been approved for initial testing by all Pioneers more than 150 LY from HQ. Please do not attempt to report any issues with this inhaler, as the lag time for messages means by the time it is received the product has already undergone several hundred iteration changes.*
>
> Warning: Hsa been known to cause explosive decompression of lungs, bleeding through the eyes, ears, and nose, and occasional dizziness followed by sudden death. Use at your own risk.

* This recipe adds a way to make Medical Inhalers without utilizing an bio components, opening up their use in other production chains added by this mod.

## Xeno-Zapper Conduit
**25 Quickwire, 15 Rubber -> 1 Xeno-Zapper (50 Quickwire/min, 30 Rubber/min -> 2 Xeno-Zappers per minute)**

> *The Xeno-Zapper, standard equipment for any Pioneer being deployed for the first time, contains a multiple mini-fission reactor in parallel, each powered by a micro gram of Dilithium. They have a half-life of 3212.92 standard galactic years, and are well suited for early exploration of a new planet. While not approved by Ficsit Approved Specialized Use, enterprising Pioneers on the frontier have made use of the capacitor for various other recipes. Such Pioneers have slipped into the Recipe databanks of Assemblers a version of the Xeno-Zapper that allows access to the reactor to be reached easier by other recipes. While it can be done with traditional Xeno-Zappers, those are usually hand crafted and that would be against the tenants Protection.*

* This recipe adds the Xeno-Zapper to automation, opening up their use in further production chains from this mod.

## Alternate: Capacitor Computers
**10 Circuit Boards, 1 Xeno-Zapper -> 1 Computer (60 Circuit Boards/min, 6 Xeno-Zappers/min -> 6 Computers/min)**

> ```There is no Recipe by this name in the Official Ficsit Approved Recipe Database```
>
> *Ficist Pioneers are often left to their own devices. One such Pioneer discovered a way to use the multiple mini-fusion reactors in the Xeno-Zapper to power Computers. They slipped this recipe into the Assembly subsystem and enterprising Pioneers can 'discover' it for themselves, along with a paired recipe for a Xeno-Zapper that is slightly easier for the Assembler to dissemble - It does mean quite a bit more circuit boards and other ingredients, but it can be done within an Assembler for less power and total machines*

* This recipe overall costs more basic ingredients, but produces more computers per minute and requires fewer machines than some other recipes (or similar, but far less power)
