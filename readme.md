# Satisfactory Mod: Vanilla Recipes: Extended

This mod aims to add additional recipes to Satisfactory, using only vanilla items, and doing so in a way that is balanced with existing recipes. Currently they are unlocked by Hub Milestones, but plans in the future include moving some into Hard Drive unlocks, some into MAM research, and others remain in the HUB

## Recipes added by this mod:

You can find all the recipes located and how they breakdown (with comparisons to existing Vanilla recipes) in [This Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1krURGQTr8L-07p3pZYBzB6UTLPTEm4AYBoCizX3Goj4/edit?usp=sharing)
