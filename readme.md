# Satisfactory Mod: Vanilla Recipes: Extended

This mod aims to add additional recipes to Satisfactory, using only vanilla items, and doing so in a way that is balanced with existing recipes. Currently they are unlocked by Hub Milestones, but plans in the future include moving some into Hard Drive unlocks, some into MAM research, and others remain in the HUB

None of the recipes added in this mod are able to be hand crafted. The goal of all recipes in this mod is to add interesting and varied new production chains using machines and paths that may not at first glance seem usual. 

I am one person with mediocre math skills. While with the help of some programming and google sheets I can muddle my way through balancing these recipes, please do not hesitate to share your feed back. **Contact me @lynkfox#4882 on the Satisfactory Modding Discord to share your thoughts or give bug reports! Just @ me in the #help-using-mods channel**

## Recipes added by this mod:

**Total New Recipes:** 13
**Total New Milestones:** 2

* [See the full changelog here](https://github.com/lynkfox/SFMod-VanillaRecipesExtended/blob/main/changelog.md)

### Upcoming:

* More Recipes!
  * **Machine Sourced** Equipment used as Input - Parachutes/Portable Miners/Medical Inhalers, reducing footprints of other recipes.
  * **More Power More Output** Use higher tier machines to produce lower tier materials, at a cost of power for far better output
  * **Pay for the Skip** Use lower tier machines to produce higher tier materials, at a cost of higher input materials and slightly lower outputs (but saving a lot of power)
  * **The Project** Use Space Elevator Project Parts for production of Medium to High tier items
  * **Horizons** Use SAM Ore, Sommersloops, Mercer Spheres, Slugs, and Alien Protein for production (along with recipes to "produce" said items)
* Move these alts into Hard-drives to be more vanilla.
  * *Since the number of hard-drives is limited and there are not that many extra over alts, either add a HD recipe or find a way to add more HDs to the game...*
* Add MAM tree nodes for certain recipes (Horizons mostly)
* Balancing - always balancing.
