You can find all the recipes located and how they breakdown (with comparisons to existing Vanilla recipes) in [This Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1krURGQTr8L-07p3pZYBzB6UTLPTEm4AYBoCizX3Goj4/edit?usp=sharing)

# ToDo:

* More Recipies!
 * Equipment used as Input: 
* Move these alts into Hard-drives to be more vanilla.
 * *Since the number of harddrives is limited and there are not that many extra over alts, either add a HD recipe or find a way to add more HDs to the game...*
