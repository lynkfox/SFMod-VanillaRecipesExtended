# Satisfactory Mod: Vanilla Recipes: Extended

This mod aims to add additional recipes to Satisfactory, using only vanilla items, and doing so in a way that is balanced with existing recipes.

# Recipes added by this mod:

You can find all the recipes located and how they breakdown (with comparisons to existing Vanilla recipes) in [This Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1krURGQTr8L-07p3pZYBzB6UTLPTEm4AYBoCizX3Goj4/edit?usp=sharing)

For a more "thematic" approach, see [this file](Recipe_Descriptions.md)

# ToDo:

* More Recipes!
 * Equipment used as Input - Parachutes/AutoMiners/HealthHypos...
 * Additional for basic materials through Heavy Frames that provide an alternate path of less machines but more bigger ones
   * use more Manufactures at earlier parts in the chain:
     * Steel/Iron/Copper in Manufacturers requiring 3 materials but less of everything to produce more
     * Utilizing Refineries for their physical byproduct
     * Blenders!
     * Particle Accelerators to create more basic materials! What?
* Move these alts into Hard-drives to be more vanilla.
 * *Since the number of hard-drives is limited and there are not that many extra over alts, either add a HD recipe or find a way to add more HDs to the game...*
